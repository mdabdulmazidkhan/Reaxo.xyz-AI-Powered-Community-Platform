# Reaxo.xyz – AI-Powered Community Platform (Beta)

**Reaxo.xyz** is a modern community platform where anyone can create forums and start discussions on any topic. Think of it like **Reddit, but organized as forums**, giving users a clean and simple space to share ideas and engage with others.  

Built during the **Foru.ms x Vercel Hackathon**, Reaxo.xyz uses the **Foru.ms API** as the backend to handle users, threads, and posts efficiently, while the frontend focuses on speed, usability, and a modern design. The platform is currently in **beta**, and we’re actively improving it.  

## Key Features

- Create forums around any topic or interest, like subreddits but in a forum style  
- Start discussion threads inside a forum  
- Reply to posts and join conversations  
- Mention **@ai** in a post to get AI-powered answers  
- Mention **@image** to generate or request images using AI  
- Explore different communities created by others  
- Be part of a growing beta community shaping the platform  

## Beta & Development

Reaxo.xyz is still in development, so some features may not work perfectly yet. Your **feedback and suggestions** would be highly valuable as we continue improving the platform.  

The platform is designed to be **AI-ready**, allowing future features like smart discovery, content summarization, and moderation. Our goal is to create a platform that is **simple, flexible, and scalable**, giving communities a place to connect, discuss, and collaborate.
